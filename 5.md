## exercise #1
1. Create unit file which will write "Hello!" into file located at /tmp/hello after executing.

Create a script.
```sh
touch /tmp/hello-script
```

Write this to the script.
```sh
#!/usr/bin/bash
echo "HELLO" >> /tmp/hello
```

Change file mode bits.
```sh
chmod +x /tmp/hello-script
```

Create a unit file.
```sh
touch /etc/systemd/system/hello.service
```

Write this to the unit file.
```
[Unit]
Description=Baz Service

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/tmp/hello
StandardError=journal
TimeoutStopSec=5
```

Start the service.
```sh
systemctl start hello.socket
systemctl status hello.socket
```

Verify it.
```sh
cat /tmp/hello
```

2. We would like to run a service on port 9999 using socket and when somebody is connected on this port we write current time of the connection into file.

Create a unit file1.
```sh
touch /etc/systemd/system/baz.socket
```

Write this to the unit file1.
```
[Unit]
Description=Baz Socket

[Socket]
ListenStream=127.0.0.1:9999
Accept=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
```

Create a unit file2.
```sh
touch /etc/systemd/system/baz@.service
```

Write this to the unit file2.
```
[Unit]
Description=Baz Service
Requires=baz.socket

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/tmp/myscript
StandardInput=socket
StandardError=journal
TimeoutStopSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Create a script.
```sh
touch /tmp/myscript
```

Write this to the script.
```sh
#!/usr/bin/bash
date >> /tmp/datenow.txt
```

Start the service.
```sh
systemctl start baz.socket
systemctl status baz.socket
```

Verify it.
```sh
cat /tmp/hello
```

3. Create templates as abc@hello which will do the 1 tast, and abc@ ...
```sh
# ...
```

4. Create three loopback devices and RAID-5 on these devices.

```sh
fallocate -l 100M file0
fallocate -l 100M file1
fallocate -l 100M file2

fallocate -f file0
fallocate -f file1
fallocate -f file2

mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 -l 5 -n 3 /dev/loop0 /dev/loop1 /dev/loop2

mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0
```

Create a unit file.
```sh
touch /etc/systemd/system/raid.service
```

Write this to the unit file.
```
[Unit]
Description=Baz Service

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/tmp/raid
StandardError=journal
TimeoutStopSec=5
```

Create a script.
```sh
touch /tmp/raid
```

Write this to the script.
```sh
#!/usr/bin/bash
fallocate -f file0
fallocate -f file1
fallocate -f file2
```

Start the service.
```sh
systemctl start baz.socket
systemctl status baz.socket
```
